## Week 2 Lab2a Assignment

**Question 1a.**  
```python
print("All the world's a stage,")
print("And all the men and women merely players:")
print("They have their exits and their entrances;")
print("And one man in his time plays many parts,")
print("His acts being seven ages")
```

**Question 1b.**  
```python
print("All the world's a stage,\nAnd all the men and women merely players:\nThey have their"
      "exits and their entrances;\nAnd one man in his time plays many parts,\nHis acts being seven ages")
```

**Question 1c.**
127.0.0.1

**Question 1d.**
If you needed to display the output immediately for the user. Example, would be a countdown timer that shows
the user the numbers as they are being counted, then "flush=true" would be useful. But alternatively, if you
wanted to track how long something takes to run for your own information but the user didnt need to see it,
then "flush=false" would be acceptable.

**Question 1e.**
The flush statement is the argument that triggers a flush. Also, a newline argument can trigger the flush 
action. 


**Notes:**  
I wasn't sure of the formatting for the assignment in github. Also, is the Python code supposed to work
work in this window. If so, im not sure how to make it "compile".
